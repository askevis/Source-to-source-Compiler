# Source-to-source-Compiler

A Source-to-source compiler completed as a school project.

As part of the project we had to design and implement core functions of a compiler.

The compliler is used to convert from Miniscript( a fictional programming language which was described to us in the uploaded pdf) to C .

For the implementation of the project I used the 'flex' and 'bison' tools. Flex was used for the lexical analysis while bison was used as a parser.
